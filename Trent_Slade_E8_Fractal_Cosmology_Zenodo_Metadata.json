    "description": "We propose a cosmological framework where an E8-symmetric scalar field, scaled by the golden ratio (\u03c6 \u2248 1.618), forms fractal-golden toroidal shells that replicate dark matter and dark energy effects via vibrational dynamics. The model links galactic rotation curves, supermassive black hole scaling, and gravitational-wave dispersion detectable by LISA. A chameleon-type screening mechanism ensures Solar System consistency. This preprint unifies fractal geometry, E8 symmetry, and MOND-like behavior into a speculative but testable structure. Predictions include \u03c6-resonant gravitational-wave phase shifts (LISA), \u03c6-scaled rotation curve wiggles (SPARC data), and super-linear SMBH-host scaling (JWST high-z sample).",
